Description: This package is used to detect combination of genomic coordinates falling within a user defined window size along with user defined overlap between identified neighboring clusters. It can be used for genomic data where the clusters are built on a specific chromosome or specific strand. Clustering can be performed with a "greedy" option allowing thus the presence of additional sites within the allowed window size.
